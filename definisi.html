<h1>Definition of Paraben</h1>
<p>Parabens are a class of widely used preservatives in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Chemically, they are a series of <em>parahydroxybenzoates</em> or <em>esters</em> of <em>parahydroxybenzoic acid</em> (also known as <em>4-hydroxybenzoic acid</em>). Parabens are effective preservatives in many types of formulas. These compounds, and their salts, are used primarily for their bactericidal and fungicidal properties. They are found in shampoos, commercial moisturizers, shaving gels, personal lubricants, topical/parenteral pharmaceuticals, spray tanning solution, makeup, and toothpaste. They are also used as food additives. 
Their efficacy as preservatives, in combination with their low cost, the long history of their use, and the inefficacy of some natural alternatives like grapefruit seed extract (GSE), probably explains why parabens are so commonplace. No effective direct links between parabens and cancer have been established.</p>
<h1>Definition of Methyl Paraben</h1>
<p>Methylparaben, also methyl paraben, one of the parabens, is a preservative with the chemical formula CH3(C6H4(OH)COO). It is the methyl ester of <em>p-hydroxybenzoic acid.</em></p>
