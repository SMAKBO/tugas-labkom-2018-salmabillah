		<p> PARABEN FUNCTIONS
As described above, PARABEN serves as a preservative because of its ability to protect the product against microbial / fungal growth.</p>

TYPES OF PARABENCE
Some types of parabens commonly used in everyday products are as follows:</p>

1. Methylparaben / Nipagin
Methylparaben is widely used as a preservative in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical products. Its use can also be combined with paraben compounds and other antimicrobial agents. It has a boiling point between 125 - 128 degrees Celsius, shaped like a colorless crystal (or white crystalline powder) and odorless. Its effectiveness has a pH range of 4-8. The commonly used concentration is the range 0.02% - 0.3%.</p>

Studies show that within reasonable limits of use, the substance is non-toxic. The recommendation from FAO and WHO (1974) is 10mg / kg body weight for daily consumption. However, based on research Meijo University Japan (2008), skin treated with methylparaben if exposed to ultraviolet light will be damaged. So, know your skin care products / cosmetics well. Read carefully the ingredients. If possible, it is better to use the product at night only.
